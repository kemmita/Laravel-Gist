when working with API reguests, we have to disable our functions within the csrf token so they can work properly.
//first go to our routes and look at our route anything with api/ we must disable csrf protection
Route::resource('api/items', 'ItemsController');

//now go to Http/Middleware/verifyCsrfToken.php go to the  protected $except array and add the extension you wish to disable
 protected $except = [
        'api/*'
    ];
