once the controller is created we will need a database to store the messages 
go to phpmyadmin and add a new database. then go to .env and do this
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=basicapp
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=


//then go to Providers/AppServiceProvider.php and make sure it looks just like mine below
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

    public function boot()
    {
        Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
    }

    public function register()
    {
        //
    }
}



//then create a model
php artisan make:model Message -m

go to your migration that was created and add the columns that need to be added.



    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('messages', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->string('email');
            $table->mediumText('message');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
    
    
    
    then run command php artisan migrate
    go to phpmyadmin to verify all is well. once the tables have been added verify that it is accepting data by filling data into the tables.
