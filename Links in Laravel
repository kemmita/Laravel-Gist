//when linking to another page we have to only link from the view, so we just provide the name of the blade. if it was nested within 
//another folder, you would have to do example.contact, which equals example/contact before we do that we have to setup a route so
//the link will work
<a href="creem" class="btn btn-success">Working</a>

//now the only reason that href is working above is becuase we declare that /cream will return view todos.creem
//typically it would just be creem, but becuase creem is in the todos folder we need to include the todos folder
route::get('/creem', function (){
   return view('todos.creem');
});
