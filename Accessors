If you wish to have all data be displayed a specfifc way, but it was all stored in a diiferent way, we can use accessors to fix that.
Lets say someone stores their name as john and the next person as Alex, one is upper and one is lower case if we want them to appear
the same we can do like I do below
//route
Route::get('/getname', 'UserController@getname');
//controller
   public function getname(){
       $user = User::find(1);

       echo $user->name;
   }

//Model, so between lines 8 and 10 the code below is being executed
//the name param is beign grabbed from the find function above. 
//ucfirst will have the first letter of the first word capitalized
//stroupper will have the whole name capital
    public function getNameAttribute($name){
       return ucfirst($name). '<br>'. strtoupper($name);
    }
