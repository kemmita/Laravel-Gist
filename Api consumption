1. First we will need to install guzzle run command <composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle:~6.0>

2. Create a route

Route::get('/github/{username}', 'ApiController@github')->name('github');


3. Create an Api controller <php artisan make:controller ApiController>

We will create a function that pulls data on a specific github user by their github name

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
// we need to use guzzle to fetch the api
use GuzzleHttp\Client as GuzzleClient;
class ApiController extends Controller
{
    public function github($username){
        $client = new GuzzleClient();
        //here we send the api get request to the dynamic uri
        $response = $client->get('https://api.github.com/users/'.$username);
        //use json_decode to convert into a php object
        $api_data = json_decode($response->getBody());
        //since the data has been converted to a php object we can pass it into a view per normal as we would do with an object from
        the db!
        return view('api')->with('data',$api_data);
    }
}
