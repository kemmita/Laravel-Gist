**Simple Route**
//Using the get function will return data what ever blade we want to use we need only to add the name of the blade file where it says 
return view. You will need a new url for this so /about will mean that example.com/about will return this view
Route::get('/about', function () {
    return view('about');
});

**Controller, non-resource Route**
//Once a user enters www.example.com/about they will be brought to the page controller and directed to the about action
Route::get('/about', 'PageController@about');


**Resource Route**


**Named Routes**
//Appending a name to the end of your route will allow you to call on the route simply by using the word contact instead of specifing
//the entire url, this is not meant for users in the browser, but for the code.
Route::get('/contact', 'PageController@contact')->name('contact');

//Now that we have appended the name contact to our route, we can use it within our anchor tags

<li class="nav-item active">
     <a class="nav-link" href="{{ route('contact') }}">Contact</a>
</li>
