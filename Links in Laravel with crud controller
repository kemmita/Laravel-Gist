//I like this way the best
<a href="{{route('comments.index')}}" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Submit</a>

so we are in a view and click a link to direct us to a new page
<li><a href="todo/create">New Todo</a></li>




//starting at the routes again you see that the url in the resource is todo and we know this resource is going to come packed with
// show, create, index and more. so if we wanted to create a button that would take us to a page to create something new, like
//a new message, we would have our href like this todo/create this url will then trasnfer to the TodoController and go right to create function
Route::resource('todo', 'TodoController');

//controller, typically this would just say create but our view is in a sub folder called todos
   public function create()
    {
        return view('todos.create');
    }
