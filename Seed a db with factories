1. to create a factory, we will first need to have some models defined in our DB to use, to create a factory, run command 
php artisan make:factory QuestionFactory. 

2. In our factory we will need to define our fields that we wish to fill 

<?php

use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(App\Question::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'title' => rtrim($faker->sentence(rand(5, 10)), '.'),
        'body' => $faker->paragraphs(rand(3, 7), true),
        'views' => rand(0,10),
        'answers' => rand(0,10),
        'votes' => rand(-3,10)
    ];
});

3. to create the random data, go back to the command line and use tinker.

4. run command php artisan tinker

5. Once in tinker run the command below to genereate the fake data. The below will generate 3 emntries.
factory(App\User::class, 3)->create()
