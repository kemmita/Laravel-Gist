first create your route
//since we are grabbing a form we use the post method in place of get
//we set the url and the call on a controller and an exact method from the chosen controller
Route::post('/contact/submit', 'MessagesController@submit');


then create our controller and go to controller

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Message;
class MessagesController extends Controller
{
// we are going to use the method below to request data from the form being submitted. If you look above, you will see
// use Illuminate\Http\Request; we use that Request to create a variable that we will call $request
    public function submit(Request $request)
    {
        //this will take the laravel validate function and make sure that the name field and email field
        //have been filled. if not an error msg will appear, but we need to go to our main layout to see how
        $this->validate($request, [
           'name' => 'required',
            'email' => 'required'
        ]);

        //create new message
        $message = new Message;
        $message->name = $request->input('name');
        $message->email = $request->input('email');
        $message->message = $request->input('message');

        //save message
        $message->save();

        //redirect
        return redirect('/')->with('success', 'Message Sent');
    }
