kind of like extending a layout, when can include a file.
to crate an include go to views add a new folder called include then add a file in the folder, I called mine sidebar
we need to create a section but for some reason not end it?
@section('sidebar')
    <div class="sidebar">
        <h3>Sidebar</h3>
        this is a sidebar

    </div>
    
now we could include this seperatly into one view but we can also add it to every view by including it in the mainlayout
<!doctype html>
<html lang="{{ app()->getLocale() }}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

</head>
<body>
@yield('content')
{{--remember when extending or including files in laravel a period is used instead of a slash.--}}
{{--below translates to in folder include and file name is sidebar.--}}
{{--Since this is the mainlayout, every view would recieve this--}}
@include('include.sidebar')
</body>
</html>



//I had to create a new include for a navigation bar, went to my include folder added a new file added a @section at the top
@section('nav')
<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="navbar-header">
            <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbar" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="navbar">
                <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            </button>
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Project name</a>
        </div>
        <div id="navbar" class="collapse navbar-collapse">
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div><!--/.nav-collapse -->
    </div>
</nav>


//went back to the mainlayout and added an inlucde
<!doctype html>
<html lang="{{ app()->getLocale() }}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

{{--it does matter where you put your includes, the way you stack them is the way it will appear in order on the screen.--}}
@include('include.nav')
@yield('content')
@include('include.sidebar')
<script src="js/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
