php artisan make:controller TodoController --resource
will create a controller with the crud methods allready there

//then go to routes and add resource this will take care of update, delete and all that stuff, other wise we would have to create
//Route::get('todo', TodoController@update);, Route::resource('todo', TodoController@delete);
//but with the code below that is all taken care of 
Route::resource('todo', TodoController);

//if you want to see all the functions that are shipped with it and how to use them, use command php artisan route:list
