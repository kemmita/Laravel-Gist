1. In your command line, run command 
php artisan make:migration questions_table

2. This will generate a new migration file in your migrations directory. In the migration file, you will want to locate the up function 
and fill in the neccesary fields.

 public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('questions', function (Blueprint $table) {
            //increments is better than integer as the integer would need to be enetered by the user every time.
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('title');
            //specify a field as nullable if it is ok to pass in nothing 
            $table->text('description')->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
    
3. Then run php artisan migrate

4. Once the table has been created, you will want to create the model for the table.
5. Run php artisan make:model Question. It needs to be singular Question so that it knows to communicate with the table questions created
above.



<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Question extends Model
{
    //
}

6. The code above will allow us to add and retrieve data from the db, remember that the fields were declared in the migration
so it is a bit different than .NET
