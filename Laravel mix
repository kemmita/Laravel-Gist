1. In our template/main layout we need to inlcude our app.js and our app.css file, these files our located in our public direcotory.
2. Using Laravel mix/webpack, we compile from our resources direcotry/sass and resources direcotry/js to the public files mentioned 
above. If we look at webpack.mix.js w3e can see this defined 

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');
   
   
3. Now we if we alter our sass code, we will need to run <npm run dev> or <npm run watch> after tyhis you can refresh your page and 
you should see the changes reflkect the code.


4.Sometimes you will need to replace asset with mix in the main layout header
<link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="{{ mix('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
