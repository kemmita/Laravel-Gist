0. Do this with transfered application, taking over an old app
1. Have the correct file path open in Gitbash and then run "composer install"
2. Go to your env.example file and rename it .env then make sure to create a new db in phpmyadmin, once you have created the db fill out
the needed info within the .env file. Below is an example.

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=exampledbname
DB_USERNAME=russell
DB_PASSWORD=password 

3. Then run php artisan key:generate. 
4. Then go to app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php and make sure it looks just like mine below

namespace App\Providers;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
    }
    public function register()
    {
    }
}

5. Then run command php artisan migrate
6. Go to phpmyadmin to verify that all is well!
