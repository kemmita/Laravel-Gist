go to resources/assets/sass and create a file called _custom.scss then go to app.scss and use the import code below

// Custom
@import "custom";


//then go into your mainlayout and include the ocde below in the head
<link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">

//if you remember we placed our custome sass in file path resources/assets/sass but this actually gets placed automatically in 
public/css/app.css


//now if you make any style changes to the sass file, you must run a npm command either in your storm terminal or cmnd line
//make sure you have the ocrrect file path if this command does not work simply close and open the cmnd termianl. the cmnd is
"npm run dev"

//when making a lot of stylke changes, run npm run watch and node will keep up with changes you are making.
