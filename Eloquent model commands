//this will return the first entry 
 $user = User::first();
//this will retireve all users
$user = User::all();

//now we can add some additional logic when adding additioanl constraints you must use get at the end
we could check names, verify ages use > < != = 
public function name(){
        $user = User::where('id', '=', 2)->get();

        return view('test')->with('user', $user);
    }
    
//here we use several wheres to add constraints to our query
  public function name(){
        $task = Tasktwo::where('completed', '=',  0)->where('id', '=', 1)->get();
        //below is the same thing as the one aboce
         $task = Tasktwo::where('completed', 0)->where('id', 1)->get();

        return view('test')->with('task', $task);
    }
    
Adding Additional Constraints
you may also add constraints to queries, and then use the get method to retrieve the results:

$flights = App\Flight::where('active', 1)
               ->orderBy('name', 'desc')
               ->take(10)
               ->get();
  
//if we want to return just on specific column from the table we can use the eloquent "pluck"
//this will only return the email
 public function name(){
        $user = User::pluck('email');

        return view('test')->with('user', $user);
    }
