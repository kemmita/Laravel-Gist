1. First we will need to get into our controller where we will need an action to fetch the data.

   public function show($id)
    {
        //use the eloquent find or fail function to locate the object via the id provided.
        $question = $this->q::findOrFail($id);
        //once found specify which view it will be displayed in, for us it will be sent to direcotry questions and to view show
        //use the with function to send the data that was located.
        return view('questions.show')->with('question', $question);
    }

2. Once in the correct view, use the variable passed from the controller to fetch the data.

    @extends('template')
    @section('content')
    //Here we will display the title field of the question, we could display and field we specify using the variable passed from the controller
    <h1>{{ $question->title }}</h1>
   @endsection
