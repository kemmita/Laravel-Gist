go to your main layout and inlcude the js and css file like you would with any other html file.
now the trick is to place your css file in public/css and then name it style.css
then for js go to public/js and then name it script.js
<!doctype html>
<html lang="{{ app()->getLocale() }}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
{{--the only thing to mention at this time, is that @yield content will place the blades we will create inside of the main layout--}}
@yield('content')
@include('include.sidebar')
<script src="js/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
