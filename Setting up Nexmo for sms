1. run command composer require nexmo/client

2. Add nexmo array to config/services.php

    'nexmo' => [
        'key' => env('NEXMO_KEY'),
        'secret' => env('NEXMO_SECRET'),
//        Grab from Nexmo dashboard.
        'sms_from' => '18023574278'
    ],

3. Go to env file and add the nexmo key and secret to the file, the key and secret will be opbtained from your nexmo dashboard.

NEXMO_KEY=e7fd8e7b
NEXMO_SECRET=I7H5yrPlz0Ct34TZ

4. Now head over to our NewAnsweSubmitted class that was created when we created Notifiable. There is a file in this repo to set that up.

//Add nexmo to the via array
    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return ['mail', 'nexmo'];
    }
 
 
//Create a toNexmo method

   public function toNexmo($notifiable)
    {
        return (new NexmoMessage)
            ->content('Your question'. $this->question->title. 'was just answered by'. $this->name.'. Check it out at Rusty Knows Everything!');
    }

//Verify that this class is including this
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\NexmoMessage;

5. Lastly in the User Model defin the route for nexmo which in this case will be the phone number associated with the user.

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;
    public function routeNotificationForNexmo()
    {
        return $this->phone;
    }
