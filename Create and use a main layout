If you would like to avoid typing out all of the general html code every blade, then we can create a layout. Go to views, add a new folder
called layout and add a new file called mainlayout. below is what the layout will look like

{{--remember that you must include this ineach blade so you can use it--}}

<!doctype html>
<html lang="{{ app()->getLocale() }}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

</head>
<body>
{{--the only thing to mention at this time, is that @yield content will place the blades we will create inside of the main layout--}}
    @yield('content')
</body>
</html>


If you wish to use your main layout go to your blades and add @extends('layout.mainlayout') at the top of the file.
If you look at line 16 above it says yield content so in order for us to grab content we have to use section tags to grab the code.
notice how we name the sction "content" now the h1 tag surrounded by the section tags will be yielded by the main layout
@extends('layout.mainlayout')
@section('content')
<h1>home</h1>
@endsection
