//first go into config/database.php and replace default mysql with pgsql
 'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'pgsql'),
 
//then go into the .env file and where you would connect your mysql, change the connection to pgsql just like you did in the file above
//then change to pg default port which is 5432 add your database name like normal and typically unles you change it, your username will
//be postgres. You were forced to create a password for postgres, so add the password you created in the gui

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=marxmanager
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password


//next go into your personal computer cdrive/xampp/php
//then go to php.ini, hit ctrl f and search for pg 
//you will find the semicolon before them means that they are commented out, so simply remove the semicolons 
;extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll
;extension=php_pgsql.dll
//so it should look like this
extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll
extension=php_pgsql.dll
//then go to xampp and restart apache 
//you can now work with the migrations and database.
